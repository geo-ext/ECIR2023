# Geographic Information Extraction from Texts (GeoExT)

## Workshop to be held to be held as part of the 45th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2023)  


In this workshop, we aim to foster the discussion and exchange on recent advances in geographic information extraction from unstructured texts. Special 
emphasis for this first GeoExT workshop is on methods for document geolocation, toponym recognition and resolution. Our goal is to establish a common, longterm 
forum to consolidate multi-disciplinary efforts addressing both, research and practitioners in Europe and beyond.
