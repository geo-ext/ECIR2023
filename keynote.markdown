<span style="font-size:20px;"> <strong> Short Bio:</strong>   Ross Purves teaches and researches at the Department of Geography of the University of Zurich. He is particularly interested in novel ways of extracting, analysing and reasoning with geographic information in ways which consider uncertainty, vagueness and diversity, often using unstructured text. Much of his work has addressed issues related to landscape and the environment.
